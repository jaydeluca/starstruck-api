## Ships

**Wraith**
- Small ship


## Battle

- Defensive structures go first
  - To offset this advantage: the more you have, the less effective they are (slightly)
- Cycle through each ship in the order
- Plunder goes to attacker
- Salvage goes to defender
  - randomized 1% - 10% cost of each lost unit
